"""Join a code symbol to the decisions that shaped it and their session sources.

MEM-16, approved 2026-08-28. The competitors hold one half each: code-graph
tools have no memory of why, memory systems have no graph of what. This vault
holds both, and the join is the question an operator actually asks: "why is
this code like this?" — symbol → decision pages that name it → the daily and
session evidence those pages cite. Research:
`docs/research/2026-08-28-code-decision-session-join.md`.

The join itself is deterministic and read-only. It does not re-verify the
byte-level citations it surfaces — `read_page` already does that per slug, and
the response says so instead of implying verification it did not perform.
